# My Holiday Pool

As I walk towards it,  
I see the water shiver.  
I tell him I am gentle,  
There is no need to quiver.  
I think I reassured him,  
That I was not a threat.  
Because he let me slide carefully,  
Into his watery depths.

I splashed around with joy,  
As I dived down ever deeper.  
No one else was out because,  
My family are great sleepers.  
Suddenly I heard a noise,  
As the door opened wide.  
Then there was a great big splash,  
As my dad attempted a dive.
